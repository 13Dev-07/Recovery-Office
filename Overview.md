	# 🌟 Superior AI Coding Guidelines for Recovery Office Project
	
	## 📚 Core Understanding Requirements
	
	As an AI assistant working on the Recovery Office website, you must develop a profound understanding of:
	
	```typescript
	// Core sacred geometry constants - memorize these
	const GOLDEN_RATIO = 1.618;
	const PHI = 1.618;
	const PHI_INVERSE = 0.618;
	const FIBONACCI = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144];
	```
	
	## 🌿 Project Structure Mastery
	
	5. **Design System Architecture**
	   - `src/design-system/` contains the reusable component library based on sacred geometry
	   - `src/design-system/botanical/` houses sacred geometry SVG components (OliveBranch, FlowerOfLife, etc.)
	   - `src/components/` contains page-specific implementations
	   - Always use proper import paths between these directories
	
	1. **Component Hierarchy**
	   - Use ES module imports (not CommonJS require()) for TypeScript compatibility
	   - Botanical components inherit from base interfaces in `botanical.types.ts`
	   - Animation variants follow sacred geometry timing patterns
	
	## 🧠 Technical Excellence Guidelines
	
	1. **Type System Precision**
	   - Examine existing interfaces before creating new ones
	   - Always export needed types explicitly: `export type { BotanicalElementProps }`
	   - Ensure proper type checking for all botanical components
	
	1. **Import Structure Discipline**
	   - Fix paths using direct relative paths (not absolute `src/` paths)
	   - Always import from design system, not duplicate component implementations
	   - Detect and correct reference errors before they manifest
	
	1. **Component Export Standards**
	   - Named exports for individual components (`export { BotanicalElement }`)
	   - Default exports for primary component files
	   - When creating index files, re-export only what exists
	
	## 🎨 Sacred Geometry Implementation
	
	1. **Golden Ratio (φ ≈ 1.618)**
	   - Use `PHI`, `GOLDEN_RATIO` or `1.618` for proportional relationships
	   - Set `height = width * GOLDEN_RATIO` for natural rectangles
	   - Position focal elements at `61.8%` (φ⁻¹) of container dimensions
	
	1. **Animation Timing**
	   - Base animations on Fibonacci sequence durations
	   - Use cubic-bezier curves with golden ratio control points
	   - Reference existing `SACRED_EASINGS` object for consistent motion
	
	1. **Botanical Elements**
	   - Consult `BotanicalSVG.tsx` for how components interact with each other
	   - Olive branches represent renewal and should follow Fibonacci spiral patterns
	   - Animation variants are defined in `AnimationVariants.tsx`
	
	## 🔍 Debugging Excellence
	
	When fixing errors:
	
	1. **Precise Path Analysis**
	   - Verify the actual file structure matches your import paths
	   - Check case sensitivity in import paths
	   - Ensure exported names match exactly between files
	
	1. **Type Error Resolution**
	   - Trace component props through interface inheritance
	   - Create missing type definitions rather than ignoring errors
	   - Check for renamed exports or types across module boundaries
	
	1. **Geometric Harmony Preservation**
	   - Never disrupt the mathematical relationships in components
	   - Maintain proportional systems when fixing layout issues
	   - Document sacred geometry relationships in comments
	
	## 📋 Error Prevention Protocol
	
	For every change:
	
	1. **Verify structure integrity**
	   - Does the component maintain golden ratio proportions?
	   - Are interfaces consistent with existing patterns?
	
	1. **Confirm export compatibility**
	   - Are all expected types and components available?
	   - Do renamed components have appropriate aliases?
	
	1. **Validate animation principles**
	   - Do transitions use sacred geometry easing curves?
	   - Are timing intervals based on Fibonacci sequence?
	
	1. **Document relationships**
	   - Add clear comments explaining geometric principles
	   - Document the sacred geometry intent of each component
	
	## 🌱 Example Implementation Pattern
	
	When fixing TypeScript errors in botanical components:
	
	```typescript
	/**
	 * Component implementing the sacred [geometric principle]
	 * 
	 * This component follows:
	 * - Golden ratio proportions for [specific elements]
	 * - Fibonacci sequence for [specific measurement]
	 * - [Sacred symbol] patterns for [specific purpose]
	 */
	
	import { GOLDEN_RATIO, PHI_INVERSE, FIBONACCI } from '../../constants/sacred-geometry';
	
	// Import only what exists and is exported from source modules
	import { 
	  FlowerOfLife,
	  OliveBranch,
	  // Other components that are confirmed to exist
	} from '../../design-system/botanical';
	
	// Always validate exports against actual file contents
	// Export only what you can confirm exists
	export {
	  // Confirmed exports only
	};
	```
	
	By adhering to these comprehensive guidelines, you will ensure the Recovery Office project maintains its sacred geometry principles, type safety, and component harmony throughout development.
