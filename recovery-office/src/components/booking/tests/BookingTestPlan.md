# Recovery Office Booking System Test Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive testing approach for the Recovery Office booking system. It covers end-to-end flow testing, validation scenarios, device compatibility, and edge cases.

## 1. End-to-End Flow Testing

### 1.1 Basic Flow Tests
- [ ] Complete a booking from start to finish with all required fields
- [ ] Verify each step transition maintains correct state
- [ ] Confirm data persists between steps
- [ ] Test back navigation preserves previously entered data
- [ ] Verify final submission sends correct data payload

### 1.2 API Integration Tests
- [ ] Test loading service information from API
- [ ] Verify date availability fetching works correctly
- [ ] Test time slot availability loading
- [ ] Verify payment intent creation
- [ ] Test booking submission flow
- [ ] Verify error handling for API failures

### 1.3 State Management Tests
- [ ] Verify context state updates correctly at each step
- [ ] Test state persistence when navigating forward/backward
- [ ] Confirm loading states display appropriately
- [ ] Verify error states trigger correctly
- [ ] Test successful booking state

## 2. Validation Scenario Tests

### 2.1 Service Selection Step
- [ ] Test submitting without selecting a service
- [ ] Verify service selection is retained when returning to step
- [ ] Test service filtering functionality (if applicable)

### 2.2 Date Selection Step
- [ ] Test without selecting a date
- [ ] Test without selecting a time slot
- [ ] Verify past dates are disabled
- [ ] Test date range limitations
- [ ] Verify unavailable time slots cannot be selected
- [ ] Test date/time selection persistence

### 2.3 Client Information Step
- [ ] Test all required fields validation:
  - [ ] First name missing
  - [ ] Last name missing
  - [ ] Email missing
  - [ ] Email invalid format
  - [ ] Phone number invalid format
- [ ] Test length limitations (min/max characters)
- [ ] Verify special character handling in text fields
- [ ] Test conditional validation (fields required based on other selections)

### 2.4 Confirmation Step
- [ ] Test without selecting payment method
- [ ] Verify credit card validation (if implemented)
- [ ] Test required checkbox validation:
  - [ ] Details reviewed unchecked
  - [ ] Cancellation policy unchecked
- [ ] Verify booking summary displays correct information
- [ ] Test payment processing error handling

## 3. Mobile & Tablet Device Testing

### 3.1 Mobile Testing
- [ ] Verify responsive layout on mobile phones (iPhone SE, iPhone 12, Pixel 5)
- [ ] Test touch interactions
- [ ] Verify mobile calendar modal works correctly
- [ ] Test pinch zoom and gestures
- [ ] Verify form element sizing (inputs large enough for touch targets)
- [ ] Test soft keyboard interactions
- [ ] Verify scrolling behavior in all steps

### 3.2 Tablet Testing
- [ ] Test iPad (9.7", 10.2", 10.5", 11", 12.9") layouts
- [ ] Verify tablet-specific two-column layout
- [ ] Test landscape vs. portrait orientation
- [ ] Verify touch interactions
- [ ] Test calendar and time slot selection in tablet layout
- [ ] Verify booking confirmation split view

### 3.3 Cross-Device Transitions
- [ ] Test starting booking on one device and continuing on another
- [ ] Verify state persistence across screens/sessions

## 4. Accessibility Testing

### 4.1 Screen Reader Testing
- [ ] Test entire flow with VoiceOver (macOS/iOS)
- [ ] Test entire flow with NVDA or JAWS (Windows)
- [ ] Verify appropriate announcements during step transitions
- [ ] Test focus management between steps
- [ ] Verify error messages are properly announced

### 4.2 Keyboard Navigation
- [ ] Complete entire booking flow using only keyboard
- [ ] Verify logical tab order
- [ ] Test focus trapping in modals
- [ ] Verify focus indicators are visible
- [ ] Test keyboard shortcuts (if implemented)

### 4.3 Color & Contrast
- [ ] Verify all text meets WCAG AA contrast requirements
- [ ] Test with high contrast mode
- [ ] Verify form error states are distinguishable without color

## 5. Edge Case Testing

### 5.1 Network Conditions
- [ ] Test with slow network connections
- [ ] Verify timeout handling
- [ ] Test offline recovery
- [ ] Verify retry mechanisms work properly

### 5.2 Browser Compatibility
- [ ] Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- [ ] Verify iOS Safari specific behaviors
- [ ] Test back/forward browser navigation

### 5.3 Special Scenarios
- [ ] Test with content blockers enabled
- [ ] Verify behavior when session expires
- [ ] Test with JavaScript temporarily disabled
- [ ] Test with large zoom levels (200%+)
- [ ] Verify handling of concurrent booking attempts

## 6. Performance Testing

### 6.1 Load Time
- [ ] Measure initial load time
- [ ] Verify step transition performance
- [ ] Test with browser performance tools

### 6.2 Animation Performance
- [ ] Verify smooth animations on low-end devices
- [ ] Test reduced motion preference
- [ ] Check for layout thrashing during animations

## 7. Bug Fixes & Refinements

| Issue | Description | Priority | Status |
