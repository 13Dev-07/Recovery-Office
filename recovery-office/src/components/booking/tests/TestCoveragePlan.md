# Booking System Test Coverage Plan

This document outlines a comprehensive testing strategy for the Recovery Office booking system, organizing test cases by component with prioritization based on critical user flows.

## Core Principles

- **User-Centric Testing**: Focus on real user flows and scenarios
- **Accessibility First**: Test with accessibility tools and keyboard navigation
- **Device Coverage**: Test on all target devices (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- **Performance Validation**: Measure and verify performance metrics
- **Sacred Geometry Verification**: Validate sacred geometry principles are applied correctly
