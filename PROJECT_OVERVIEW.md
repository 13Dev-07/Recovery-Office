# Recovery Office Project Overview

## 🌟 Project Description

Recovery Office is a premium financial recovery consultancy specializing in helping individuals and businesses reclaim lost financial assets due to fraud, investment scams, or financial misconduct. The project aims to create a professional, trust-inspiring website that leverages sacred geometry principles in its design to subconsciously communicate values of trustworthiness, stability, and renewal.

## 🎯 Core Mission

- **Expert Guidance**: Providing clear, transparent consultation backed by deep regulatory expertise.
- **Trust & Credibility**: Leveraging official FCA/BaFin compliance and oversight to assure clients of legitimacy and security.
- **Empowerment & Education**: Offering resources that educate clients about financial recovery processes.
- **Transparency & Integrity**: Clear communication about fee structures, recovery timelines, and potential outcomes.

## 🎨 Brand Identity

The Recovery Office brand is defined by principles of professionalism, trustworthiness, stability, and renewal. The visual identity incorporates sacred geometry principles to subconsciously communicate these values.

### Color Palette
- **Forest Green (#0A4021)**: Trust, stability, growth
- **Ivory (#F8F7F0)**: Clarity, purity, professionalism
- Accent colors derive from the Golden Ratio (≈ 1.618)

### Typography
- **Headings**: Serif fonts (Playfair Display, Baskerville) for authority
- **Body Text**: Sans-serif (Open Sans) for readability and clarity
- Typography scales follow Golden Ratio proportions

### Botanical Elements
- Olive branches symbolize peace, renewal, and recovery
- SVG illustrations follow Fibonacci spiral patterns

## 🌀 Sacred Geometry Implementation

The entire design system is built around sacred geometry principles:

### Golden Ratio (Φ ≈ 1.618)
- All layouts, spacing, and typography scales follow Golden Ratio proportions

### Fibonacci Sequence
- Base spacing units: 8px → 13px → 21px → 34px → 55px → 89px
- Used consistently for spacing between elements and sections

### Sacred Symbols
- Vesica Piscis, Flower of Life, Platonic Solids, and Golden Spiral integrated into visual elements

## 📐 Technical Stack

The website utilizes a modern React-based stack:

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| React + TypeScript | Frontend framework with type safety |
| Styled-components | CSS-in-JS styling with theme support |
| Framer Motion | Animations based on natural curves |
| React Hook Form + Zod | Form validation |
| React Router | Client-side routing |

## 🛠️ Key Components & Design Elements

### Navigation System
- Responsive navigation bar with transitions from transparent to solid on scroll
- Menu items spaced according to Fibonacci sequence intervals
- Regulatory credentials prominently displayed

### Hero Sections
- Dimensions follow golden rectangle proportions
- Olive branch animations follow Fibonacci spiral paths

### Service Cards
- Cards designed as perfect golden rectangles
- Interactive hover effects use Fibonacci increments

### Booking Interface
- Multi-step form structured according to sacred geometry proportions
- Progress indicators positioned using golden ratio divisions

### Animation System
- All animations reflect natural rhythms inspired by sacred geometry
- Custom easing curves based on Golden Ratio (`cubic-bezier(0.618, 0, 0.382, 1)`)
- Timing durations follow Fibonacci milliseconds increments

## 📚 Design System Core Elements

The design system is built around several key elements:

1. **Sacred Constants**: Core mathematical values (PHI, GOLDEN_RATIO, etc.)
2. **Botanical Components**: Visual elements based on sacred geometry (FlowerOfLife, VesicaPiscis, etc.)
3. **Animation Components**: Specialized components for different animation types
4. **Layout Components**: Grid systems and containers based on golden proportions

## 🧩 TypeScript & Code Organization

The project uses TypeScript for type safety and follows these patterns:

- Consistent interface definitions for component props
- Organized type files that can be imported across the application
- Styled component patterns with theme support
- Export patterns for clean component imports

## ✨ Next Steps for Rebuilding

When rebuilding this project, focus on:

1. Setting up the sacred geometry constants and design system first
2. Implementing the core botanical components
3. Building the animation system
4. Developing the page templates and navigation
5. Implementing the booking system components

The goal is to create a visually harmonious website that inspires trust through subtle application of sacred geometry principles in every aspect of the design.
