# Recovery Office Website Rebuild - Next Session Prompt

## Session Objective: Contact Page Implementation Following Sacred Geometry Principles

In our previous sessions, we've successfully implemented:
1. The Home page with all required sections
2. The Services page with comprehensive section components
3. The About page with detailed section components

For our next session, we'll focus on implementing the Contact page and its section components, ensuring strict adherence to sacred geometry principles throughout. This is a critical page as it represents the conversion point for potential clients and must embody the trust and harmony principles of Recovery Office.

## Detailed Contact Page Requirements

### 1. Contact Page Structure
The Contact page should include the following sections:
- ContactHero section with background image and botanical elements
- ContactForm section with sacred geometry proportioned form fields
- ContactInfo section displaying office locations and contact methods
- ContactMap section showing office locations visually
- ContactTestimonials section with select testimonials related to client experience

### 2. Sacred Geometry Implementation Requirements
- Use PHI (1.618) constant for all proportional relationships
- Apply Fibonacci sequence numbers for all spacing values
- Position key elements at the Golden Ratio point (61.8%)
- Implement grid systems based on Golden Ratio
- Ensure animations follow sacred timing principles
- Apply sacred geometry utility functions for calculations

### 3. Technical Implementation Requirements
- Create each section as a separate component in `/src/pages/Contact/sections/`
- Implement strict TypeScript typing with comprehensive interfaces
- Create responsive layouts for all viewport sizes
- Apply proper accessibility attributes (ARIA)
- Implement form validation with Zod schemas
- Ensure all animations have reduced motion alternatives

### 4. ContactForm Component Requirements
The form should include:
- Name field (first and last name)
- Email field with validation
- Phone number field with formatting
- Subject dropdown with service categories
- Message text area with auto-resize
- Preferred contact method selection
- GDPR/Privacy consent checkbox
- Submit button with loading state
- Completion state with confirmation message

### 5. ContactMap Component Requirements
- Interactive map showing office locations
- Location markers with botanical styling
- Info windows with office hours and contact details
- Responsive sizing based on Golden Ratio
- Accessibility features for screen readers

### 6. Animation Requirements
- Subtle scroll-triggered animations for each section
- Form field focus animations following sacred timing
- Success/error state animations for form submission
- Map marker animations with sacred proportions
- Ensure all animations respect reduced motion preferences

## Implementation Steps

1. **Initial Setup**
   - Create the Contact page base component
   - Set up the sections directory structure
   - Define all required interfaces and types

2. **Hero Implementation**
   - Create the ContactHero component with background image
   - Implement botanical decorations with sacred proportions
   - Add responsive text with proper spacing

3. **Form Implementation**
   - Create the ContactForm component with all required fields
   - Implement Zod validation schemas
   - Design form layout using sacred geometry grid
   - Add form submission logic with error handling
   - Implement success/error states and animations

4. **Contact Information Section**
   - Implement ContactInfo component with office details
   - Design cards for each location following Golden Ratio
   - Add contact method icons with proper spacing
   - Implement responsive grid layout for different devices

5. **Map Integration**
   - Create ContactMap component with map integration
   - Design custom markers with botanical elements
   - Implement interaction behaviors (click, hover)
   - Ensure proper loading states and fallbacks

6. **Testimonials Integration**
   - Select testimonials related to client experience
   - Implement testimonial carousel with sacred timing
   - Design testimonial cards with golden ratio proportions

7. **Accessibility Enhancements**
   - Add proper ARIA labels to all interactive elements
   - Ensure keyboard navigation works correctly
   - Implement focus management for form fields
   - Add screen reader announcements for state changes

8. **Final Integration**
   - Combine all sections in the main Contact component
   - Ensure proper spacing between sections
   - Test responsive behavior across breakpoints
   - Validate all sacred geometry proportions

## Technical Considerations

- **Performance**: Optimize the map component to prevent layout shifts
- **Security**: Implement proper form validation and sanitization
- **Accessibility**: Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all elements
- **Sacred Geometry**: Document all sacred proportions with comments
- **TypeScript**: Maintain strict typing with no any types

## Validation Criteria

The completed Contact page should:
1. Follow all sacred geometry principles consistently
2. Work flawlessly across all device sizes
3. Handle form submission with proper validation and feedback
4. Be fully accessible via keyboard and screen readers
5. Display properly in all major browsers
6. Include proper documentation for all sacred geometry implementations

By completing this detailed implementation, we'll continue building the Recovery Office website with the same attention to sacred geometry principles, type safety, and user experience that we've established in previous components.
